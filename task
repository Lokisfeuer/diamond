Topic = 'Biology'

give me 500 keywords to the topic biology
for each keyword:
	15 Requests  # these should be explicitly different to each other and the demands and Questions
	15 Demands
	15 Questions
	5 factual statements

500*50 = 25000

# Give me 25 subtopics of biology  # generate 1000 sentences for each.

Give me 250 topics fully unrelated to biology

for each topic:
	30 Requests
	30 Demands
	30 Questions
	10 factual statements

fine tune modells for each to simplify structure!
